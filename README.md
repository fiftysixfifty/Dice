Simpson Strong-Tie Programming and Design Project

 

Create a simple ASP.NET MVC application in C# to simulate a pair of loaded 6-sided dice. The program will be controlled by the following information:

 

- For each die, the face to be favored.

 

- For each die, an integer factor in the range of 1 to 5 to apply to the favored face.  For example, if the “6” face of a die is favored by a factor of 2, the 6 is twice as likely to appear as each of the other faces, 1 to 5.

 

- An integer value specifying the number of times the dice should be rolled with the current settings.

 

- Store the runtime results.

 

The program should read the input from your web page and “roll the dice” according to the settings found there and display the results of each roll.
